text = "Sliding is another foundational technique to know. 

It has two main benefits:
The obvious one, you can fit under tall things.
The less obvious, you experience little to know fricition in the beginning moments of a slide.

Repeatedly jumping out of slides--or slidehopping--is an easy way to maintain momentum by minimizing speed loss to friction.
