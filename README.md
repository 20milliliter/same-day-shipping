# Same Day Shipping

Same Day Shipping is a love letter to Source Engine movement, lo-fi hip hop, and the beauty of nature.

`Movement`, `Relaxing`, `Nature`, `Atmospheric`, `Great Soundtrack`

## Overview

You are a humanoid robot capable of extreme-speed travel, purpose-built to deliver packages to various locations throughout the world as quickly as possible. 
Despite everyone being seemingly gone, you still get assigned packages, so you still deliver.

## World

The world itself is quite diverse, featuring the following areas:

- Forest
- Urban
- Tundra
- Mountains
- Farmlands
- Industrial
- Harbor
- Trainyard
- Mines (Desert)

All areas are found in relative disarray and have been overtaken by nature. You receive a set of packages you must deliver to a location in each of these areas (might reduce this to only a random subset of all areas) as quickly as possible.

To do so, you are equipped with a grappling hook, a double jump, wallrunning, and Source Engine movement exploits:

- Air Strafing,
- Bunnyhopping
- ABH
- Edgebugs

Plus, some more borrowed from elsewhere:

- Slidehops
- Firstyâ€™s

## Unique Selling Point

Most games of this general type focus on either precise platforming, or realistic parkour systems. All games of this specific type (Source movement) focus only on Bhopping (and are pretty much just analogous to Aimlab). None ever tout the rich vertical movement that Source can create, nor a distinct visual style and great soundtrack.
